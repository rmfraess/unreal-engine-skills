Each skill is a self-contained folder following the
[Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification): a `SKILL.md` with YAML
frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus Markdown instructions, optionally accompanied by
`references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/`.

## Who/what these are for

The consumer is an **autonomous agent**, not a human clicking through the editor. The agent:

- Writes and edits **Unreal C++** (gameplay classes, modules, build files).
- Works with **Blueprints, assets, and editor concepts** to assemble and configure games.
- Has the **Unreal Engine source** available on disk to cross-reference exact APIs.

Skills are pure **UE domain knowledge**: correct classes, real API signatures, the right
patterns, the gotchas, and references into the engine source — not click-by-click UI
tutorials, and not tool/automation instructions. The agent brings its own tooling (e.g. an
MCP bridge to a live editor) and has separate skills for that; these skills tell it *what is
correct in Unreal*, not *which tool to operate*.

## Target environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary engine version | **UE 5.8** |
| Engine source for cross-ref | 5.8 (binary install incl. source); 5.7 install kept for version diffing |
| Engine source root (5.8) | `Engine/Source` under `UE_ENGINE_ROOT` |

Skills target 5.8 APIs. Where an API moved or changed between 5.x versions, the skill notes it.

### Marketplace asset pack skills

Skills for widely-used marketplace asset packs. These follow the same authoring style as the rest
of the repo (frontmatter, system tables, *When to use*, *Gotchas*, *References & source material*)
with one deviation from convention: skills cite the pack's documentation + its plugin asset paths (`Blueprints/...`, `Materials/...`,
`Particles/...`) instead of `Engine/Source/...`, and code patterns are Blueprint-flavored
pseudocode for packs that have no public C++ API.

## Updating existing installations

Skill names and folders now use the `ue-` prefix so they are easier to identify
alongside skills for other tools. For example, `enhanced-input` is now
`ue-enhanced-input`. Names that already had the prefix, such as
`ue-cpp-fundamentals`, are unchanged.

After updating, replace previously copied skill folders instead of keeping both
versions. Update explicit skill invocations, configured paths, and saved discovery
URLs to use the new names. Category IDs and reference filenames are unchanged.

## Authoring conventions

See [`docs/skill-authoring-guide.md`](docs/skill-authoring-guide.md). In short:

- One skill = one folder under `skills/`; folder name **must equal** the `name` frontmatter.
- `name`: lowercase letters/digits/hyphens, ≤64 chars, no leading/trailing/double hyphens.
- `description`: ≤1024 chars, states **what it does and when to use it**, with searchable keywords.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines; push deep detail into `references/`.
- Ground claims in real 5.8 source paths; cite `Engine/Source/...` locations.
- Prefer C++ that compiles against 5.8; flag version-specific behavior.

## Validation

Validate any skill against the spec with the
[`skills-ref`](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) tool:

```
skills-ref validate ./skills/<category>/<skill-name>
```

Verify that every engine-source citation in the skills still exists on disk (run after
editing skills, and when re-targeting a new engine version). First set
`UE_ENGINE_ROOT` to your UE 5.8 installation directory (the one containing `Engine/`):

```
node scripts/check-citations.mjs            # all skills
node scripts/check-citations.mjs core/ue-gameplay-tags   # one skill
```



## Evals

`evals/tasks/` holds golden tasks for high-traffic skills — realistic prompts with
checkable acceptance criteria, used to compare an agent's output with and without the
skill loaded. See [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md) for the method and the UE 5.8
compile-check workflow.
