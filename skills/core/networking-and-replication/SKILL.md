# Networking & replication

Unreal multiplayer is **server-authoritative**: the server holds the ground truth and replicates
state to clients; clients send intent to the server via RPCs. Nearly every multiplayer bug is an
authority or replication-setup mistake. Design state ownership first (`gameplay-framework`), then
replicate it correctly.

## When to use this skill

- Replicating actor state (health, ammo, doors, scores) to all clients.
- Letting a client ask the server to act (fire, interact, ability use) via an RPC.
- Choosing between `Replicated` vs `ReplicatedUsing`, or picking a `COND_*` condition.
- Setting up dormancy, net update frequency, or relevancy for performance at scale.
- Diagnosing "it works in PIE single-player but breaks in multiplayer".
- Adopting Push Model or `FFastArraySerializer` for efficient high-scale replication.

## Authority and roles

Every actor copy has a role on each machine:

| Role constant | Where it appears | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ROLE_Authority` | Server (or standalone) | Authoritative copy — make decisions here |
| `ROLE_AutonomousProxy` | Client — your own pawn | Locally controlled; can predict |
| `ROLE_SimulatedProxy` | Client — others' actors | Simulated from received replication |

```cpp
if (HasAuthority())   // true on server / standalone
{
    // authoritative gameplay change
}
bool bIsLocallyControlled = (GetLocalRole() == ROLE_AutonomousProxy);
```

`HasAuthority()` inlines to `GetLocalRole() == ROLE_Authority`
(`GameFramework/Actor.h`:1938, :4967).

Server RPCs execute on the server; state changes must happen on the server and replicate down.
Clients send *intent*, not *state*.

## Actor replication setup

```cpp
AMyActor::AMyActor()
{
    bReplicates = true;          // enable replication
    SetReplicateMovement(true);  // replicate transform (non-Character actors)
    NetUpdateFrequency = 10.f;   // updates/sec (use SetNetUpdateFrequency in 5.5+)
    NetDormancy = DORM_DormantAll; // start dormant; call FlushNetDormancy before changing props
}
```

`bReplicates` (`Actor.h`:593), `SetReplicates` (`Actor.h`:759), `NetDormancy` (`Actor.h`:869),
`bAlwaysRelevant` (`Actor.h`:333), `NetUpdateFrequency`/`SetNetUpdateFrequency` (`Actor.h`:905,
:4624).

Key actors by design: GameMode is server-only. GameState and PlayerState are built to replicate
(`gameplay-framework`). `SetReplicates(true)` at runtime triggers a replication start callback
— in Iris projects (5.7+), override `OnReplicationStartedForIris` rather than the deprecated
`OnReplicationStarted`.

## Property replication

Mark the property and register it in `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps`. Replication flows
**server → clients** only.

```cpp
// MyActor.h
UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_Health)
float Health = 100.f;

UPROPERTY(Replicated)
int32 Ammo = 30;

UFUNCTION()                        // must be UFUNCTION
void OnRep_Health(float OldHealth);// optional previous-value param

virtual void GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(
    TArray<FLifetimeProperty>& OutLifetimeProps) const override;
```

```cpp
// MyActor.cpp
#include "Net/UnrealNetwork.h"

void AMyActor::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(
    TArray<FLifetimeProperty>& OutLifetimeProps) const
{
    Super::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(OutLifetimeProps);
    DOREPLIFETIME(AMyActor, Health);
    DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(AMyActor, Ammo, COND_OwnerOnly);
}

void AMyActor::OnRep_Health(float OldHealth)
{
    // Fires on clients when Health arrives. Use it to react:
    // update UI, play hit FX, etc. OldHealth is the pre-update value.
}
```

- Set replicated properties **on the server** only; changes on a client are local and discarded.
- `DOREPLIFETIME` expands to `DOREPLIFETIME_WITH_PARAMS` with default `FDoRepLifetimeParams`
  (`UnrealNetwork.h`:259).
- `DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(Class, Prop, COND_*)` saves bandwidth — see
  [references/replication-conditions-and-push-model.md](references/replication-conditions-and-push-model.md).
- Full macro reference and `DOREPLIFETIME_WITH_PARAMS_FAST` (compile-time, no arrays):
  [references/property-replication.md](references/property-replication.md).

## RPCs (remote procedure calls)

```cpp
// MyPawn.h — declare only; UHT generates the thunk
UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable, WithValidation)
void ServerFire(FVector_NetQuantize HitLocation);   // client → server

UFUNCTION(Client, Reliable)
void ClientPlayEffect(int32 EffectId);              // server → owning client

UFUNCTION(NetMulticast, Unreliable)
void MulticastSpawnFX(FVector Loc);                 // server → server + all clients
```

```cpp
// MyPawn.cpp — implement as _Implementation; validate as _Validate
void AMyPawn::ServerFire_Implementation(FVector_NetQuantize HitLocation)
{
    // runs on server — do authoritative hit processing here
}

bool AMyPawn::ServerFire_Validate(FVector_NetQuantize HitLocation)
{
    // return false to disconnect the cheating client
    return HitLocation.Z > -10000.f;
}

void AMyPawn::ClientPlayEffect_Implementation(int32 EffectId)
{
    // runs on the owning client only
}

void AMyPawn::MulticastSpawnFX_Implementation(FVector Loc)
{
    // runs on server AND all relevant clients — use for cosmetic FX only
}
```

RPC rules:
- **Server** RPC — called on a client, runs on the server. The actor must be **owned** by that
  client (its pawn or PlayerController, or an actor whose Owner chain reaches them). Calling on a
  non-owned actor is silently dropped.
- **Client** RPC — called on the server, runs on the **owning client**.
- **NetMulticast** — called on the server, executes on the server and all currently relevant
  clients. Not replayed for late joiners; use a replicated property + OnRep for persistent state.
- **Reliable** — guaranteed delivery with ordering; reserve for gameplay-critical calls.
  **Unreliable** — fire and forget; use for frequent cosmetic calls. Flooding reliable RPCs can
  saturate the channel.
- `WithValidation` is required by Epic coding standards for all Server RPCs that accept parameters
  from untrusted clients. Returning `false` from `_Validate` disconnects the caller.

Full RPC reference and execution matrix: [references/rpcs.md](references/rpcs.md).

## Ownership & relevancy

- **Owner**: determines which client can invoke Server RPCs on the actor, and which client
  receives `COND_OwnerOnly` data. Set with `SetOwner` or `FActorSpawnParameters::Owner`.
- **Relevancy**: an actor only replicates to connections for which it is relevant (`bAlwaysRelevant`
  bypasses the check). Override `IsNetRelevantFor` to customize.
- **Net dormancy**: actors set to `DORM_DormantAll` are skipped entirely during replication
  consideration — the most impactful server-side optimization. Call `FlushNetDormancy()` before
  changing any replicated property while dormant.
- **NetUpdateFrequency** / **NetCullDistanceSquared**: tune per actor class to balance fidelity
  vs bandwidth.

## Movement replication

`ACharacter` + `UCharacterMovementComponent` handle movement with client prediction automatically
(`character-and-movement`). Do not manually `SetActorLocation` every tick on a networked character
— drive input through CMC.

## Multiplayer testing

PIE: set **Number of Players > 1** and **Net Mode** to "Play As Listen Server" or "Play As Client"
to run a multi-machine session locally. Always test authority paths in multi-player PIE, not
standalone — standalone makes every actor authoritative and hides ownership bugs.

Console: `net.DormancyEnable 0` to disable dormancy while debugging; `NetEmulation.PktLag 100`
to simulate 100ms latency.

## Gotchas

- **Changing replicated state on a client** — does not propagate; only the server's change
  replicates.
- **Forgot `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps`/`DOREPLIFETIME`** — property never replicates, silently.
- **Server RPC on a non-owned actor** — dropped without error; check ownership chain.
- **Multicast for late-joiner state** — multicasts don't replay. Use a replicated property +
  `OnRep` so new clients receive the state on join.
- **Reliable RPC flood** — every Reliable RPC occupies a slot; flooding saturates the channel and
  stalls all replication for that connection.
- **Modifying replicated property while dormant** — the change is present locally but skipped by
  the replication system until `FlushNetDormancy` is called (and even then may be lost); always
  call `FlushNetDormancy()` before changing props on a dormant actor.
- **GameMode server-only** — putting client-observable state in GameMode means clients can't see
  it; use GameState.
- **RepNotify not firing on server** — `OnRep_X` only fires automatically on clients; if the
  server needs the same side-effect, call `OnRep_X()` explicitly after setting the value.

## Version notes

- **5.5+**: `NetUpdateFrequency` direct write is deprecated; use `SetNetUpdateFrequency()` /
  `GetNetUpdateFrequency()` (`Actor.h`:903).
- **5.8 / Iris**: The Iris replication system remains beta and opt-in in 5.8
  (`net.Iris.UseIrisReplication`, default off). It coexists with the
  existing property/RPC model — existing `DOREPLIFETIME` and RPC code continues to work. Iris
  replaces `OnReplicationStarted` (deprecated 5.7) with `OnReplicationStartedForIris`. For Push
  Model with Iris, use `DOREPLIFETIME_WITH_PARAMS_FAST` + `bIsPushBased = true`. See
  [references/replication-conditions-and-push-model.md](references/replication-conditions-and-push-model.md).
