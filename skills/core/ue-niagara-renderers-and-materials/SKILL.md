# Niagara renderers and materials

Use `ue-niagara-vfx` for the system, emitter, component, and gameplay parameter model. Choose the renderer from the shape and camera behavior the effect needs; no particular texture, mesh, material, or course asset is required.

## Renderer choice

| Renderer | Useful for | Attribute and material checks |
|---|---|---|
| Sprite | Smoke, fire, glows, soft impacts, flipbooks | Sprite size and alignment; SubUV grid and frame progression; alpha over age and overdraw |
| Mesh | Chunks, shells, debris, volumetric silhouettes | Mesh scale and orientation, pivot, UVs, material slot, mesh bounds |
| Ribbon | Continuous trails, energy strokes, moving beams | Stable ordering, enough source particles, width over age, facing and discontinuities |

Sprite and mesh size are separate particle attributes. Changing sprite size will not scale a mesh renderer; use the mesh scale attribute or a mesh-specific scale module. Particle color affects a mesh only when its material consumes particle color (or a bound equivalent). Check the material's shading and blend mode before diagnosing a missing Niagara color curve.

For ribbons, decide whether the trail follows moving particles or forms a deliberate beam between endpoints. Supply enough points for a smooth curve, but cap spawn rate and lifetime so old segments do not linger. On teleports, respawns, or abrupt attachment changes, reset or replace the trail to avoid a line across the scene. If multiple ribbons share an emitter, bind and test their ribbon IDs and ordering rather than relying on incidental particle order.

## Material and animation design

- For flipbook sprites, make the Sprite Renderer subimage grid match the actual atlas. Drive frame selection over particle age, with optional start-frame variation and interpolation if the atlas supports it. Check that a looping system does not make every sprite advance in lockstep.
- For panning or distorted UVs, keep the base silhouette readable and vary one frequency or axis at a time. Mask distortion near card edges so the rectangular particle does not become visible. Evaluate mipmaps, tiling, and temporal stability at the intended camera distance.
- Bind particle color, alpha, and any dynamic material parameter only where the material uses them. A parameter written by Niagara without a matching material read has no visual effect. Favor a small, documented set of material inputs over a crowded collection of unrelated controls.
- Render-target drawing can generate or update a source texture, but it is optional. Use existing materials or procedural inputs when they already provide the requested appearance; do not require a baked atlas or imported pack.

## Review in context

Inspect the effect from gameplay camera angles, with scene lighting and exposure representative of the level. For translucent layers, inspect overdraw, sort order, depth intersections, and bounding behavior. A ribbon may look smooth in a static preview yet fail on fast turns; a mesh may look correct close up yet reveal its card, pivot, or UV seam at distance. Reduce layer count or lifetime before increasing particle count to hide those problems.
