# UDS time of day

UDS has a single canonical time variable, three categories of runtime control (set / animate / transition), four getter functions, and a complete event-dispatcher system for game logic that needs to react to time. For real-world astronomical positioning (lat/long/date), see `uds-simulation`.

| Concern | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Set the time | `Time of Day` variable (0–2400 float) or `Time of Day String` ("3PM", "15:45") |
| Day/night cycle | **Animate Time of Day** category: Day Length + Night Length (minutes) |
| One-off runtime change | `Set Time with Time Code`, `Set Date and Time`, `Set Time of Day With String` |
| Smooth transition over time | `Transition Time of Day(targetValue, duration)` |
| Read the time | `Get Time of Day`, `Get Time Code`, `Get Date Time`, `Is It Daytime?` |
| React at specific times | Event dispatchers: Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight/Hourly/Custom Time |
| Display the time | Built-in clock widgets in the widget designer palette |

## When to use this skill

Use these branches only after Ultra Dynamic Sky is confirmed as the system owning time of day.

- Setting up a day/night cycle.
- Triggering game events at sunrise, sunset, midnight, hourly, or arbitrary custom times.
- Setting time programmatically from gameplay code (instantly or as a transition).
- Reading the current time in HH/MM/SS form, or just checking "is it day".
- Putting a clock on screen.
- Syncing game time across multiplayer.

## Setting the time

`Time of Day` is a float on UDS, 0–2400, in the **Basic Controls** category. You can also type a string like `"3PM"` or `"15:45"` into `Time of Day String`. Setting `Time of Day` directly at runtime instantly changes the time.

## Animating time (day/night cycle)

In the **Animate Time of Day** category, enable **Animate Time of Day**. Then:

| Setting | Unit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Day Length` | minutes of real time | Between sunrise and sunset |
| `Night Length` | minutes of real time | Between sunset and sunrise |

When `Simulate Real Sun` is enabled (see `uds-simulation`), Day Length / Night Length are ignored — speed comes from **Simulation Speed** in the Simulation category (`1` = roughly real-time).

## Runtime control functions

Get a UDS reference with the shared `Get Ultra Dynamic Sky` function. Then call:

| Function | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Set Time with Time Code(TimeCode)` | Set time from an hours/minutes/seconds Time Code struct |
| `Set Date and Time(DateTime)` | Set time using a Date Time struct (incl. simulation date) |
| `Set Time of Day With String(string)` | Parse `12:34 PM`, `18:30`, `5AM`, etc. See function description for full list. |
| `Transition Time of Day(target, duration)` | Animate to `target` over `duration` seconds |

Direct `UDS.TimeOfDay = X` also works for instant changes.

## Sampling the current time

| Function | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `Get Time of Day` | Float 0–2400 |
| `Get Time Code` | Time Code struct (h/m/s) |
| `Get Date Time` | Date Time struct (h/m/s + simulation date) |
| `Is It Daytime?` | Boolean — true when the sun is up |

`Is It Daytime?` is the right call when you only need day-vs-night, not the exact time.

## Display widgets

Two clock widgets in the widget designer palette under **Ultra Dynamic Sky Widgets**. Drop into a UMG widget for a quick on-screen clock.

## Event dispatchers

Bind events from your Blueprints. In Blueprint, obtain and validate the actor with `Get Ultra Dynamic Sky`, then use `Bind to Sunrise` / `Bind to Sunset` and matching custom events. Inspect the installed Blueprint's dispatcher signatures before writing native bindings; display names do not establish a C++ `OnSunrise` member or `GetUltraDynamicSky()` function.

| Dispatcher | When it fires | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Sunrise` | Minute the sun crosses horizon going up | — |
| `Sunset` | Minute the sun crosses horizon going down | — |
| `Midnight` | Time of Day passes 0/2400 | — |
| `Hourly` | Each hour. Fires for *every* hour skipped over by an instant time change. | Current hour (int) |
| `Current Hour Changed` | Like Hourly but fires *once* for the new current hour after an instant skip | Current hour (int) |
| `Every Minute` | Each minute | Current minute (int 0–59) |
| `Custom Time` | Time of Day crosses any value in the `Custom Time Dispatchers` float array | Array index that triggered (int) |

### Offsetting Sunrise / Sunset

`Sunrise Event Offset` and `Sunset Event Offset` in **Animate Time of Day** shift the trigger minute relative to the actual horizon cross.

### Event check frequency

`Time Event Dispatcher Check Period` (Animate Time of Day) — how often the dispatcher logic checks for triggers. Default: every second whenever Time of Day is actively changing.

### Hourly vs Current Hour Changed

If a fast `Transition Time of Day` skips from 14:00 to 18:00:

| Dispatcher | Times it fires | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Hourly` | 4 times (15, 16, 17, 18) | "Tick the clock for each hour passed" |
| `Current Hour Changed` | 1 time (18) | "React to the new current time" |

### Custom Time example

In **Animate Time of Day**, set `Custom Time Dispatchers` to `[630, 1230, 2200]`. Bind to `Custom Time`. The bound event fires:

| Index | At Time of Day |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 06:30 |
| 1 | 12:30 |
| 2 | 22:00 |

Use the index in a Switch to branch per scheduled time.

## Material functions for time

Search the material palette:

| Function | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Day to Night Float` | Interpolates between two float inputs based on whether sun is up. Inputs offset horizon threshold and widen/sharpen the transition. |
| `Day to Night Color` | Same for colors. |

Good for materials that switch (e.g. emissive on at night) without involving a blueprint. For *light components* that turn on at night (not just materials), use the **Light Day/Night Toggle** component — see `uds-lighting-and-shadows`.

## Sequencer

To keyframe Time of Day in Sequencer:

1. **Disable Animate Time of Day** on UDS (otherwise it overrides your keys).
2. Keyframe `Time of Day` directly. Going past 2400 is fine — UDS rolls into the next day.

Many UDS variables are exposed for cinematics, but not all are re-applied dynamically every frame. If a keyframed value doesn't update at runtime, mark it `Expose to Cinematics` in the UDS blueprint and call the matching `Static Properties - <Category>` function each frame. (Weather state has its own Sequencer notes — see `udw-setup-and-state`.)

## Multiplayer replication

`Time of Day` and `Date` are replicated.

| Variable | Replication behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Replicated Time of Day` | Updated periodically; on change, clients sync `Time of Day` to it |
| `Day Length`, `Night Length`, `Time Speed`, `Simulation Speed` | Replicated themselves |

Clients tick time locally between resyncs the same way the server does. Brief desync between resyncs is normal; the periodic `Replicated Time of Day` update realigns them.

## Gotchas

- **`Time of Day` won't change at runtime** — the sun is **static or stationary mobility**. Time-of-day cannot change at runtime with non-movable sun. See `uds-lighting-and-shadows`.
- **Keyframes in Sequencer have no effect** — `Animate Time of Day` is still on and overriding. Disable it.
- **Sunrise/Sunset firing at the wrong time** — `Simulate Real Sun` is on, which uses real horizon crossing rather than `Dusk Time` / `Dawn Time`. (See `uds-simulation`.) Or there's a Sunrise/Sunset Event Offset configured.
- **Hourly firing many times after `Transition Time of Day`** — that's `Hourly`'s intended behavior (every hour passed). Use `Current Hour Changed` for "once for the new hour".
- **Custom Time never fires** — `Custom Time Dispatchers` array is empty. Add values.
- **Animation speed feels wrong despite Day Length / Night Length** — `Simulate Real Sun` is enabled and overriding to use `Simulation Speed` instead.
