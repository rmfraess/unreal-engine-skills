# UDS clouds

UDS renders clouds via one of four mutually exclusive systems plus a shared movement/wisp/light-ray layer. This skill covers each system's settings, the cloud painter, the light-ray effect, and the looping/troubleshooting recipes. For *which* cloud mode to choose, see `uds-setup-and-modes`.

| Sky Mode | What it draws | GPU cost | Notable per-mode tool |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Volumetric Clouds | Full 3D clouds, real shadows | Heaviest | Volumetric Cloud Painter, Cloud Profile Authoring Tool |
| Static Clouds | Static texture with packed lighting angles | Cheap | Static Clouds Authoring Tool |
| 2D Dynamic Clouds | Panning 2D textures on the sky sphere | Cheap | — |
| Voxel Clouds | Hard cubic voxel render of Volumetric Clouds | Heavy | Same tools as Volumetric Clouds |

## When to use this skill

Use these branches only after Ultra Dynamic Sky is confirmed as the system owning the clouds.

- Tuning the look (altitude, scale, density, color, second layer) of any cloud type.
- Cutting cloud-rendering GPU cost.
- Painting localised cloud coverage (gaps over mountains, clouds in a basin).
- Authoring a custom cloud shape profile, or generating a custom static cloud texture.
- Configuring volumetric cloud light rays (god rays through cloud gaps).
- Making the clouds loop seamlessly for a film render.
- Diagnosing dark clouds, hard mesh intersections, blurry-when-moving, or in-layer artifacts.

## Volumetric Clouds

Richest and most expensive cloud option. Category: **Volumetric Clouds**.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Volumetric Cloud Rendering Mode` | Exposes `r.volumetricrendertarget.mode`. Each mode prioritizes a tradeoff — Performance, Quality, Mesh Intersections, Long Trail, etc. |
| `Bottom Altitude` | Cloud layer height. **Use this, not actor translation** (which breaks atmosphere/fog). |
| `Volumetric Clouds Scale` | Uniform scale of the cloud field |
| `View Sample Scale` / `Shadow Sample Scale` | Sample counts. Lower = cheaper but noisier. |
| `Max High Frequency Noise Levels` | Detail when close/zoomed in. Cost scales with the High Frequency Noise Distance Scale. |
| `Second Cloud Layer → Two Layers` | Adds a second layer with offset. Requires much higher sample count; significant cost increase. |

### Authoring custom cloud shape

The **Cloud Profile Authoring Tool** generates the Cloud Profile LUT texture UDS samples for cloud shape.

- Launch: **Ultra Dynamic Sky** dropdown on the level editor toolbar, *or* run the editor utility at `Blueprints/Tools/`.

### Volumetric Cloud Painter

Paint local cloud coverage on top of the global `Cloud Coverage` value. Carve gaps over a mountain, or paint clouds into a basin.

- UDS must be in the scene with Sky Mode = Volumetric Clouds.
- Launch: **Ultra Dynamic Sky** dropdown on the toolbar, *or* the editor utility in `Blueprints/`.
- Painting data is held in **UDS Cloud Paint Container** actors. One level can hold many; the painter creates a new one or opens an existing one.

Painter UI:

| Area | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Top bar | Brush: texture, strength, falloff, spacing |
| Viewport | LMB paint, RMB pan, MMB zoom (or buttons lower-right) |
| View modes (lower-left) | Three options; lock icon ties painter view to level viewport |
| Left side | Three coverage levels (red/green/blue) and erase (black) |
| Bottom | **Save to Textures** — commits painting to texture assets in `UDS_LevelData/` next to the level |

Container resolution / mapping to the cloud coverage render target is configured on UDS in the **Volumetric Cloud Painting** category.

```
// Switching active container at runtime:
ContainerA.Deactivate()
ContainerB.Activate()
```

### Volumetric Cloud Light Rays

When the cloud layer has a gap (painted or just low coverage), UDS renders distant light rays through it. Category: **Volumetric Cloud Light Rays** (enabled by default).

Rays are giant additive cards driven by a Niagara system — **not** volumetric fog and **not** screen-space light shafts.

- Adjust color and spacing of ray cards.
- **Individual Cloud Light Rays** — also casts rays through gaps in overall high-coverage formations (not just painted gaps). Can render many more ray cards; cost rises significantly.

## 2D Dynamic Clouds

Panning 2D textures on the sky sphere. Category: **2D Dynamic Clouds**.

These are a material effect on the sky sphere — they don't exist in 3D space. `Cloud Height` is fake-perspective distortion in the sky material, not real altitude.

Advanced dropdown: distribution settings (concentrate around horizon, reduce around the moon, etc.).

Perf: enabling **One Cloud Layer** reduces sky shader cost (already on at Low material quality).

## Static Clouds

Static texture with multiple lighting angles packed in, approximating lighting changes as sun/moon move. Category: **Static Clouds** — swap texture, control rotation.

### Static Clouds Authoring Tool

Generates a new static clouds texture by rendering UDS's volumetric clouds.

- Launch: **Ultra Dynamic Sky** dropdown on the toolbar, *or* the editor utility at `Blueprints/Tools/`.

## Voxel Clouds

Hard cubic voxel rendering style; internally an alternate renderer for Volumetric Clouds. Category: **Voxel Clouds** holds voxel-specific settings, but most cloud settings come from the **Volumetric Clouds** category (textures, altitude, colors). Affected by the Volumetric Cloud Painter and Radial Storm local coverage.

## Cloud Movement

Category: **Cloud Movement** — controls movement of Volumetric Clouds *and* 2D Dynamic Clouds.

| Setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Cloud Speed` | Overall speed |
| `Cloud Direction` | Degrees. UDW's wind direction overrides if UDW is in the scene. |
| `Cloud Phase` | Phase variable. Useful when Cloud Speed = 0; primary control for looping / keyframed movement. |
| `Randomize Cloud Formation On Run` | New random formation each play |
| `Clouds Move With Time of Day` | Keeps cloud movement synced when time speed varies (good for time-lapses) |
| `Formation Change Speed` | Used in seamless looping (see below) |

### Seamless looping (for film renders)

The loop requires the cloud formation texture to complete one full 0–1 UV cycle. Steps:

In **Cloud Movement**:
- `Cloud Speed` = 0 (drive time via `Cloud Phase`).
- `Cloud Direction` along a single axis (0, 90, 180, or 270).
- `Formation Change Speed` = 1 (or 0.5 → loop twice as long).

In **Volumetric Clouds**:
- `3D Noise Scale` = 1.
- `Cloud Formation Texture Scale` = 1.
- `Macro Variation` = 0.
- `3D Noise Vertical Movement` = 0.

```
// Keyframe in Sequencer:
CloudPhase: 0 → 100   (loops seamlessly)
// (Or with Formation Change Speed = 0.5: 0 → 200)
```

## Cloud Wisps

High-altitude wispy layer rendered as a static texture on the sky behind every Sky Mode except Space. Category: **Cloud Wisps**.

How it works: samples a grayscale texture (R channel only) and applies a wisp color that varies with time of day. Opacity is scaled by two `Cloud Wisps Opacity` settings — one for low cloud coverage, one for high.

- `Cloud Wisps Texture` — swap. Keep grayscale.
- Movement effect (default on) warps the texture over time with cloud direction, fading with an offset mapping to create a seamless loop.

## Runtime / Blueprint control

```
// Active properties — set directly, cache picks up automatically:
UDS.CloudCoverage = 0.8   // (use UDW instead if present)
UDS.CloudPhase    = 47.5
UDS.CloudSpeed    = 0.3
UDS.CloudDirection = 90

// Container actors (Cloud Painter data):
ContainerA.Activate() / ContainerA.Deactivate()
```

For **static** cloud properties (texture swaps, noise scales, etc.), call `Static Properties - Volumetric Clouds` (or the relevant category function) after changing the variable; or `Hard Reset Cache` for a complete refresh. See `uds-performance-mobile-troubleshooting`.

## Performance

| Lever | Cost impact |
| --- | --- |
| Sky Mode (Volumetric → Static → 2D → None) | Largest GPU perf lever on the system |
| `Volumetric Cloud Rendering Mode` (use Performance variants) | Significant |
| `View Sample Scale`, `Shadow Sample Scale` (reduce) | Cheaper but noisier |
| `Two Layers` (off) | Big saving |
| `Max High Frequency Noise Levels` (lower) | Cheaper close-up |
| `One Cloud Layer` (on, for 2D Dynamic) | Reduces sky shader cost |
| `Individual Cloud Light Rays` (off) | Saves many ray cards |

## Gotchas

- **Volumetric clouds look dark/gray** — usually the directional light. If using **Custom Sun/Moon Light Actor**, copy `Cloud Scattered Luminance Scale` exactly from UDS's built-in component (UDS can't set this on a custom actor). Otherwise it's a leftover directional light in the level that wasn't removed before adding UDS.
- **Hard mesh intersections** — default rendering mode prioritizes background quality. Switch `Volumetric Cloud Rendering Mode` to a mode that prioritizes Mesh Intersections.
- **Clouds blurry/streaky when moving fast** (e.g. time-lapse) — default mode resolves with a long history trail. Switch to any other `Volumetric Cloud Rendering Mode`.
- **Translucent materials render in front of clouds** — on the material → **Translucency settings** → enable `Apply Fogging` *and* `Apply Cloud Fogging`. For some meshes also enable `Compute Fog Per Pixel` (otherwise cloud fogging is per-vertex).
- **Banding/noise inside or above the layer** — defaults tuned for ground viewing. Raise `View Sample Count Scale` (costs perf), lower `Tracing Max Distance` (two settings: inside/outside layer), adjust `Close View Sample Ratio`.
- **Moving the UDS actor to change altitude** — wrong; use `Bottom Altitude`.
- **Setting Cloud Coverage on UDS has no effect** — UDW is in the scene. Set on UDW's weather state instead.
- **Voxel mode looking for unique settings** — most live in **Volumetric Clouds**, not **Voxel Clouds**.
