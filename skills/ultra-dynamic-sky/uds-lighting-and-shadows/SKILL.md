# UDS lighting and shadows

UDS owns three lights (sun, moon, sky light) as components on the actor, and a cloud-shadow system that works for every Sky Mode. This skill covers those components, sky light modes, exposure, light shafts, static/stationary setup, and the runtime utilities for time-of-day-responsive lights.

| Light | Type | Settings category | Cost lever |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sun | Directional light component on UDS | **Sun** | Affects shadow cost, cloud shadows |
| Moon | Directional light component on UDS | **Moon** | Affects shadow cost, cloud shadows |
| Sky Light | Sky light component on UDS | **Sky Light** | Mode chooses cost vs flexibility |
| Cloud Shadows | Effect on the directional lights | **Cloud Shadows** | Works with every Sky Mode |
| Screen Space Light Shafts | Engine `Light Shaft Bloom` toggle | **Screen Space Light Shafts** | Cheap; only when facing the light |
| Exposure | Auto / Manual auto-exposure control | **Exposure** | Drives the whole image brightness |

## When to use this skill

Use these branches only after Ultra Dynamic Sky is confirmed as the system owning sky lighting.

- Configuring or limiting the sun/moon directional lights.
- Choosing or tuning the sky light mode (capture / cubemap / tinted).
- Diagnosing black, too-dark, or unresponsive ambient light.
- Setting up baked / static / stationary lighting with UDS.
- Enabling Light Shaft Bloom god rays for the sun/moon.
- Making placed lights in the level (lamps, neon) turn on at sunset.
- Making emissive materials switch on at night without writing blueprint.
- Working with a Custom Sun/Moon Light Actor (and the Cloud Scattered Luminance Scale gotcha that comes with it).

## Light components on UDS

UDS owns **Sun** and **Moon** directional light components, plus a Sky Light component. Select UDS and find them in the component list at the top of the details panel.

Settings UDS controls per light: color, intensity, cast shadows, light source angle. Everything else is editable directly on the component.

For sun/moon **positioning and appearance**, see `uds-sun-moon-stars`.

### Custom light actors (avoid unless required)

Pointing UDS at an external light actor (instead of the built-in components) is supported but **not recommended** unless a specific need forces it (e.g. a third-party plugin that requires a light actor reference).

If you do, two extra steps are needed:

| Light type | Manual fix-up |
| --- | --- |
| Directional (sun/moon) | Manually set `Cloud Scattered Luminance Scale` on the actor to match UDS's Sun/Moon component value. UDS can't set this from blueprint. **Copy the value/color exactly.** |
| Sky light | Set `Source Type` to match UDS's `Sky Light Mode`: <br>• `Cubemap with Dynamic Color Tinting` or `Custom Cubemap` → `Specified Cubemap`<br>• `Capture Based` → `Captured Scene` |

If volumetric clouds look strangely dark/gray when using a custom sun/moon actor, **missing Cloud Scattered Luminance Scale** is almost always the cause.

### Lights update throttling

`Lights Update` settings in the **Directional Light** category — throttle how often the lights' rotation actually updates. Cached sun/moon rotations are applied to visuals every frame, but the lights' real rotation can update less frequently. Useful for reducing cached directional shadow invalidation cost.

## Cloud Shadows

Category: **Cloud Shadows**. Enabled by default and compatible with **every** Sky Mode, even cloudless modes.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Intensity / softness with cloud coverage | Full overcast fully occludes by default; low coverage only partial |
| Shadow contribution when Fog / Dust high | Adjustable directional light occlusion in those states |
| `2D Cloud Shadows Speed`, `2D Cloud Shadows Scale` | Texture-based shadow for non-Volumetric Sky Modes |

For Volumetric Clouds, shadows are accurate to the 3D layer — every cloud casts its own correct shadow. Other Sky Modes use the 2D texture-based shadow.

### Cloud Shadows + single-layer water

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Single-layer water lit by sun in cloudy weather when it shouldn't be | Project Settings → enable `Single Layer Water Uses Light Function Atlas`. UDS cloud shadows support the light function atlas, so water reads them correctly. |
| Sun reflection near sunset/sunrise doesn't match cloud coverage that should block it | In Cloud Shadows category: enable `Correct Specular Scale For Low Angle Cloud Shadows` |

## Sky Light

`Sky Light Mode` in the **Sky Light** category.

| Mode | How it works | When to pick |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Capture Based** | Generates a cubemap by capturing the sky. Real-time capture exposed as an option. | Hero quality, supports full dynamic sky |
| **Custom Cubemap** | Static cubemap set via `Sky Light Cubemap` | Locked-in scene with a single look |
| **Cubemap with Dynamic Color Tinting** | Flat gray cubemap dynamically tinted with fog color to align with time of day | Best for dynamic time of day at low cost; works on every platform (incl. mobile without real-time capture) |

`Sky Light Color Multiplier` settings tint differently per Time of Day. Values >1 scale intensity proportionally.

## Exposure

UDS controls exposure by default. Auto exposure (Unreal's "eye adaptation") is what lets brightness adapt to scene light. Category: **Exposure**.

| Setting | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `Apply Exposure Settings` | Master toggle for UDS taking exposure ownership |
| Exposure Compensation Curve | Pushes brightness higher/lower based on overall scene light level |
| `Exposure Bias` (per scenario) | Per-time-of-day, per-weather exposure compensation. e.g. "make night exposure brighter, cloudy darker." |
| `Exposure Metering Mode` | Whether auto exposure is on, and which type. Set to **Manual** to disable auto exposure but keep using bias settings. |
| `Exposure Brightness Range` (MinEV100 / MaxEV100) | The range auto exposure adapts within |

For debugging auto exposure: viewport view mode **Show → Visualize → HDR(Eye Adaptation)** shows what auto exposure is doing.

## Static / stationary lighting

UDS defaults to movable lights, but supports static / stationary too.

To switch a UDS light to static or stationary, find its mobility setting in the corresponding UDS category (**Sun**, **Moon**, **Sky Light**). **Set the mobility from the exposed UDS setting, not on the component itself.**

After the level's lighting is built:

| Constraint | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Can still tweak some sky settings | Material params, etc. |
| Settings that move/alter lights break the build | Any directional light change invalidates lightmaps |
| Static/stationary **sun** → `Time of Day` cannot change at runtime | Light mobility prevents rotation at runtime |

## Screen Space Light Shafts

`Light Shaft Bloom` — engine-level directional light feature: cheap screen-space god rays. Only renders when facing the light. **Not** related to volumetric fog (which can achieve similar visuals via a different method).

Category: **Screen Space Light Shafts** — toggles per sun / moon.

## Light Day/Night Toggle component

For a light component placed in the level (lamp, neon sign) that should turn on at sunset and off at sunrise.

| Setup step | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Add the component | `Blueprints/Utilities/Light Day/Night Toggle` as a child of the light component on an actor |
| Default behavior | On at night; flip via setting on the component |
| Power-on animation | Component animates intensity as the light powers on (imitating warm-up lamps). Toggle/adjust on the component. |
| Drive material parameters | The component can drive a `Light Toggle` scalar parameter (0–1) on an array of dynamic material instances |

Hierarchy: the toggle component **must be a child of the light component** to control it.

## Material functions for lighting

Search the material palette:

| Function | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Day to Night Float` / `Day to Night Color` | Interpolate between two inputs based on whether sun is up. Inputs offset threshold and widen/sharpen the transition. Good for emissive-on-at-night without blueprint. |
| `Active Sun or Moon Vector` | Unit vector toward whichever body is up (sun by day, moon by night). Also outputs a 0–1 mask that drops to 0 at the swap moment — multiply effects by it to hide pop artifacts. |

## Runtime / Blueprint control

Most lighting variables that change with time/weather (color, intensity, scattered luminance) update via the cache automatically.

For *static* lighting properties (mobility, source type, certain advanced light setup), set the variable then call `Static Properties - Sun`, `Static Properties - Moon`, or `Static Properties - Sky Light` to apply. For a complete instant refresh, `Hard Reset Cache`.

## Gotchas

- **Scene renders black after adding UDS** — exposure. In order: (1) disable any post-process volume overriding exposure; (2) viewport **Lit** dropdown → check **Game Settings** for exposure; (3) on UDS disable **Apply Exposure Settings** in the Exposure category.
- **Ambient light starts correct then stops updating as time changes** — sky light isn't updating. Platform may not support real-time sky light capture; switch `Sky Light Mode` to **Cubemap with Dynamic Color Tinting** (works everywhere, dynamic). Or it's leftover static light from a baked solution — run a lighting build.
- **Ambient light slow to adapt after a fast sky change** — that's Lumen's default GI update speed. UDS doesn't touch Lumen. Adjust **Lumen Global Illumination → Update Speed** in a post-process volume (raises GPU cost).
- **Volumetric clouds look dark/gray** with a Custom Sun/Moon Light Actor — `Cloud Scattered Luminance Scale` isn't set on the actor. Copy the value from UDS's directional light component. Without a custom actor, it's a leftover directional light in the level that wasn't removed before adding UDS.
- **Single-layer water lit incorrectly under cloudy sky** — Project Settings → enable `Single Layer Water Uses Light Function Atlas`. UDS cloud shadows support the atlas.
- **`Time of Day` won't change at runtime** — sun mobility is static or stationary. Movable required for runtime time changes.
- **Set Sun Light Color at runtime, no effect for 1–2 seconds** — cache system interpolates. Call `Hard Reset Cache` for an instant change, or lower `Max Property Cache Period` in **Scalability / Performance**.
- **Set Sun Softness at runtime, no effect at all** — static property. Set the variable, then call `Static Properties - Sun`.
