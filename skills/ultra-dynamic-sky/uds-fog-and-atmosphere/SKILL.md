# UDS fog and atmosphere

UDS owns three air-shading systems — height fog, volumetric fog, and the global volumetric material — plus a sky-coloring layer with two backends. This skill covers each and the interactions between them.

| System | Category | What it does | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Height fog (density) | **Fog Density** | Distance-based opacity, height falloff, start distance | Cheap |
| Height fog (color) | **Fog Color** | Tint of the height fog (overridden by Sky Atmosphere by default) | Cheap |
| Volumetric Fog | **Volumetric Fog** | 3D fog receiving local light, scatters | **Expensive** |
| Global Volumetric Material | **Volumetric Fog** | 3D noise extinction, ground fog, underwater extinction | Adds cost on top of Volumetric Fog |
| Dust | **Dust** | Imitates dust/smoke/particulates in the air (affects fog density + color) | Cheap |
| Sky Atmosphere | **Sky Atmosphere** | Realistic atmospheric scattering (default Color Mode) | Costlier than Simplified |
| Simplified Color | **Simplified Color** | LUT-based sky coloring with adjustable color values | Cheap |

## When to use this skill

Use these branches only after Ultra Dynamic Sky is confirmed as the system owning atmosphere.

- Tuning how thick fog gets with cloud coverage / weather / dust.
- Making fog look different per weather (cloudy, foggy, dusty).
- Enabling volumetric fog and dealing with its cost.
- Adding ground fog or 3D noise variation to the fog.
- Setting up underwater fog tinting/extinction.
- Picking between Sky Atmosphere and Simplified Color for sky shading.
- Tuning sunset/twilight color, Rayleigh scattering, or overcast luminance.
- Diagnosing a hard fog line, sky flickering black, or pixelated volumetric fog.

## Fog Density

Category: **Fog Density**. Derives the height fog component's density, falloff, and start distance from inputs like Cloud Coverage, Fog, and Dust Amount.

| Output | How it's derived |
| --- | --- |
| `Density` | Base value + contributions added for Cloud Coverage, Fog, Dust Amount |
| `Height Falloff` | Base value + separate falloffs for cloudy / foggy / dusty (used directly, not summed) |
| `Start Distance` | Derived from current density. A start distance at low density + a density value at which start distance reduces to 0 (fog right up to the camera) |

Increasing Cloud Coverage / Fog / Dust automatically thickens distance fog. For different moods per weather, tune the per-state contributions in this category.

## Fog Color

Category: **Fog Color**. The project setting **Support Sky Atmosphere Affecting Height Fog** is what determines whether these settings are actually used.

| Project setting state | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled *(typical default, recommended)* | Height fog colors come **directly from the sky atmosphere**. Most Fog Color settings on UDS are ignored. |
| Disabled | Fog uses Fog Color settings only. Use for full direct control. |

This dependency disappears entirely if `Color Mode = Simplified Color` — Simplified Color doesn't enable the sky atmosphere, so all Fog Color settings are live.

### Path Tracer distance fog

UDS 9.5 offers `Render Height Fog In Path Tracer Using Post Process` as a distant-fog
approximation. UE 5.8.2 also supports native volumetric fog; use `uds-cinematics-rendering`
to choose and verify the intended path rather than assuming the engine has no fog support.

## Volumetric Fog

Unreal's volumetric fog renders advanced fog nearby the camera that receives/scatters light from local sources and supports variable color/extinction via volumetric materials. Enable from the **Volumetric Fog** category.

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Enable | Master toggle |
| Overall extinction | How dense the volumetric fog is |
| Distance from camera | How far volumetric fog renders |
| `Volumetric Scattering Intensity` (sun + moon) | How brightly each light source lights the volumetric fog |

### Performance and scalability

Volumetric Fog is expensive. Notes:

| Fact | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Volumetric Fog is a renderer feature | Scalability comes from the **Shadow Quality** group |
| Default scalability for Low and Medium disables volumetric fog | Many users won't see it on their hardware unless quality is High+ |
| UDS's Global Volumetric Material adds cost on top | Cost increases noticeably with global material on |

## Global Volumetric Material

Also in **Volumetric Fog** category. Adds global controls of extinction and color.

| Feature | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| Texture-based 3D noise | Variation to the fog extinction |
| Weather Mask brush masking | Mask volumetric fog where Weather Mask Brush / Projection Box actors are placed. See `udw-material-and-screen-effects`. |
| Ground fog | Additional extinction directly above distance fields. Requires project setting that generates mesh distance fields. |
| Underwater extinction + albedo | Applied below the water level set in **Water Level** category. See `uds-modifiers-configs-state`. |

## Dust

Category: **Dust**. Imitates dust/smoke/particulates in the air.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Dust Amount` | Affects fog density, height falloff, fog color |
| `Dust Color` | Color used for fog when Dust Amount = 1 |
| Density-specific settings | In the **Fog Density** category |

If UDW is in the scene, **UDW takes control of `Dust Amount`** as part of weather state.

## Sky Atmosphere

When `Color Mode = Sky Atmosphere` (default), main sky color comes from the **Sky Atmosphere** category.

| Setting | Drives |
| --- | --- |
| `Rayleigh Scattering` (day / night / dawn-dusk) | Main sky color. Adjustable per time band. |
| `Sunset/Sunrise`, `Twilight` | The sky atmosphere component's `Absorption` setting. Use for stronger colored sunsets, altered twilight tone. |
| `Sky Atmosphere Overcast Luminance` | Scales intensity of all sky colors when Cloud Coverage is high |

## Simplified Color

When `Color Mode = Simplified Color`, main sky color comes from the **Simplified Color** category. Cheaper at the material level than Sky Atmosphere, more directly tweakable.

| Setting | Drives |
| --- | --- |
| Color variables (base sky, light/dark cloud) | 2D Dynamic Clouds and Static Clouds cloud colors. (Volumetric cloud color is in the Volumetric Clouds category.) |
| `Directional Intensity` (float curve) | How directional light intensity dims as it nears the horizon |
| `Directional Light Scattering` (color curve) | How directional light color is filtered as it nears the horizon |
| Sun / Moon atmosphere LUT textures | Volume textures sampled by the sky material to derive atmospheric colors from camera vector and sun/moon orientation |

The LUT textures are involved to author from scratch. For tweaks, prefer doing color transforms on the included textures.

## Runtime / Blueprint control

```
// Active properties — set directly, cache picks up:
UDS.Fog          = 0.4    // (use UDW instead if present)
UDS.CloudCoverage = 0.7
UDS.DustAmount   = 0.2

// Volumetric fog enable / extinction / distance — many are static:
UDS.bEnableVolumetricFog = true
UDS.CallStaticPropertiesVolumetricFog()   // apply
```

If a runtime change has no effect, look for the matching `Static Properties - <Category>` function and call it. Last-resort full refresh: `Hard Reset Cache`. See `uds-performance-mobile-troubleshooting`.

## Performance

| Lever | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Use `Color Mode = Simplified Color` | Skips Sky Atmosphere; cheaper sky material |
| Disable Volumetric Fog | Big win — Volumetric Fog is expensive |
| Disable Global Volumetric Material | Saves the cost added on top of Volumetric Fog |
| Disable Ground Fog feature | Avoid the distance-field tracing cost |

## Gotchas

- **Hard line where fog/atmosphere suddenly starts** — sky atmosphere position is wrong relative to the scene. Place UDS at ground level so the camera is never significantly *below* the UDS actor.
- **Sky color flickers black when moving the camera** — engine bug; camera dipped below the sky atmosphere "ground". Select the **Sky Atmosphere** component on UDS (in the top components list) and move it down below the lowest point the camera can reach.
- **Volumetric fog pixelated / low quality** — that's project scalability. Volumetric fog's scalability cvars are in the **Shadow Quality** group. UDS doesn't override them.
- **Volumetric fog completely invisible** — default Low/Medium engine scalability **disables** volumetric fog entirely. Check scalability settings.
- **Fog Color changes have no effect** — `Support Sky Atmosphere Affecting Height Fog` project setting is on, so fog colors come from the sky atmosphere. Either disable the project setting or switch `Color Mode` to Simplified Color.
- **`Dust Amount` ignored on UDS** — UDW is in the scene; UDW's weather state owns it.
- **Ground Fog feature has no effect** — project setting to generate mesh distance fields is off. Enable it.
