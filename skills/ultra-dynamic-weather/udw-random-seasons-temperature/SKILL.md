# UDW random weather, seasons, climate, temperature

The systems that make weather feel naturally varied over time: random variation, seasonal cycles, climate-aware probability, and the temperature system that derives values from all of it.

| System | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Random Weather Variation | **Random Weather Variation** category | Periodic random weather changes per season-weighted probability |
| Seasons | **Season** category | 0–4 float (Spring → Winter) driving probability maps + temperature ranges |
| Climate Presets | **Random Weather Variation** category | One-shot real-world climate data → probabilities + temperature |
| Temperature | **Temperature** category | Calculated from weather state + season + biases + interior |
| Temperature Volumes | `Blueprints/Weather_Effects/` actor | Per-region temperature offsets |

## When to use this skill

- Setting up weather that changes by itself periodically.
- Making weather change with seasons.
- Picking a real-world climate (tropical, alpine, desert) for a region.
- Reading temperature in F or C from gameplay code.
- Adding local hot zones (near fire) or cold zones.
- Displaying current temperature on screen.
- Driving materials based on the season.

## Random Weather Variation

Periodically picks a new weather preset based on season and probability maps. Category: **Random Weather Variation**.

### Timing modes

| `Random Weather Variation` mode | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| **Random Interval** | `Random Weather Change Interval` (min/max seconds) — system holds a preset for a random time then picks a new one |
| **Daily** | Once per in-game day at the time set by `Random Weather Change Hour` |
| **Hourly** | Each in-game hour |

`Transition Length` — fraction of the interval between changes devoted to transitioning old → new.

### Probability maps

The **Weather Type Probabilities** maps hold weather presets and their relative probabilities. Values are *relative*:

```
{ Rain: 5, Partly Cloudy: 1, Clear: 1 }
   → Rain is 5x as likely as either of the others
```

Which map is *used* depends on the current season (see below). Different probability maps per season is how spring rains differ from summer heat.

### Begin Play behavior

| `Begin Play Weather is Random` | Behavior at play start |
| --- | --- |
| True | A random weather is selected on play start |
| False | Starts with whatever weather the level editor was displaying; changes after the first interval |

### Climate Presets

Same category — apply a **climate preset** to populate the probability maps with real-world climate data, and set temperature ranges in the **Temperature** category accordingly. Fastest way to get believable weather for "tropical jungle", "alpine", "desert", etc.

### Returning to random after a manual change

`Change Weather` (see `udw-setup-and-state`) switches to a static preset. To go back:

```
UDW.ChangeToRandomWeatherVariation()
```

## Seasons

Category: **Season**. The `Season` variable is a float 0–4:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Mid Spring |
| 1 | Mid Summer |
| 2 | Mid Fall |
| 3 | Mid Winter |
| 4 | Wraps back to Spring |

Whole values = middle of a season (where its data is applied purely). In-between values = transition. `0.5` = half Spring + half Summer.

### Where Season comes from

| `Season Mode` setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Derived from date | Uses UDS's date (Simulation category, increments per day). See `uds-simulation`. |
| Uncontrolled | `Season` variable is uncontrolled — set yourself via `SetSeason(value)` |

When deriving from date:

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Season Day Offset` | Shifts what date corresponds to what season value |
| `Meteorological Seasons` | Whether the seasons (at offset 0) represent meteorological or astronomical |

### Sampling season in materials

| Material node | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `Sample UDW Season` | 0–1 per season (four values, total = 1) |
| `Season Color Blend` | Blends 4 color inputs based on current season |

Use for season-driven material effects (autumn foliage colors, winter rock tinting).

## Temperature

Category: **Temperature**. Sample via:

```
UDW.GetCurrentTemperature(unit, sampleLocation)
// unit: Fahrenheit or Celsius
// sampleLocation: Global, or per-location (volumes + interior)
```

### How temperature is calculated

Treated as a **product** of weather, not a driver of it:

```
1. Start at 0
2. Add every Temperature Bias value in the Temperature category
   (biases reflect factors like Time of Day and weather state)
3. Map the resulting -1..1 value into the Min/Max range for current season
4. Add a slowly-changing random value, scaled by Randomize Temperature
5. If sampleLocation != Global:
   - Sample Temperature Volumes in the level
   - Apply Interior Temperature based on Player Occlusion of the sample point
     (Player Occlusion is on UDS — see uds-modifiers-configs-state)
```

### Temperature and Weather Override Volumes

Weather Override Volumes apply their own temperature ranges while the player is inside. Configurable per-WOV or disablable. See `udw-spatial-weather`.

### Temperature Volumes

Actor class **Temperature Volume** at `Blueprints/Weather_Effects/`. Place to create local temperature effects.

Example: place around a fire with a positive `Temperature Offset` — temperature sampled inside the volume reads higher.

### Show temperature on-screen

**UDW Thermometer** widget in the widget designer palette under **Ultra Dynamic Sky Widgets**. Samples and displays current temperature. Drop into a UMG widget.

## Runtime / Blueprint scripting summary

| Action | API |
| --- | --- |
| Change weather to a preset | `ChangeWeather(preset, transitionLength)` |
| Change to manual state | `ChangeWeather(null, transitionLength)` |
| Switch from manual back to random | `ChangeToRandomWeatherVariation()` |
| Set season manually | `SetSeason(value)` (when Season Mode isn't deriving from date) |
| Sample temperature | `GetCurrentTemperature(unit, sampleLocation)` |
| Sample season in materials | `Sample UDW Season` MF, `Season Color Blend` MF |

## Gotchas

- **Random Weather Variation doesn't fire** — mode is set to something other than Random Interval / Daily / Hourly. Pick a timing mode.
- **Begin Play weather isn't random** — `Begin Play Weather is Random` is false. Set it true.
- **Random weather always picks the same preset** — probability map has a strong bias toward one entry; or there's only one entry in the map. Verify the map for the current season.
- **`SetSeason` has no effect** — `Season Mode` is set to derive from date, which overrides manual season. Switch Season Mode to "Uncontrolled" first.
- **Temperature reads always the same despite weather changing** — `Temperature Bias` values aren't configured for the weather you care about. Add bias entries for that weather/time-of-day.
- **`GetCurrentTemperature(local)` reads same as Global** — sample location is set to Global, or there are no Temperature Volumes / Player Occlusion isn't computing occlusion at that location. See `uds-modifiers-configs-state`.
- **Climate preset overwrote a custom probability map** — applying a climate preset is destructive to the maps. Save a config asset first (see `uds-modifiers-configs-state`) before experimenting.
