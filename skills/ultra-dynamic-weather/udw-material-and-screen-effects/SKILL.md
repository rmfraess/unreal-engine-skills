| Dynamic Landscape Weather Effects V3 (DLWE) | Material function | Material wetness / snow / dust + DLWE Interaction component |
| Glass Window Rain Drips | Material function | Rain |
| Foliage Wind Movement | Material function (WPO) | Wind |
| Water Surface Rain Ripples | Material function | Rain |
| Rainbow | Material in sky / screen | Rain + fog + sun exposure |
| Screen Droplets | Screen effect | Rain + camera facing |
| Screen Frost | Screen effect | Snow / material snow / manual |
| Heat Distortion | Post process | Temperature (or manual) |
| Post Process Wind Fog | Post process | Fog / Rain / Snow / Dust + wind |
| Puddle Fluid Volume | Actor (real water mesh) | Weather state |
| Dripping Mesh Particles | Niagara on mesh | Rain / material wetness |
| Freezing Breath | Niagara on actor | Cold temperature |
| Rain Drip Spline | Spline actor | Rain (+ optional icicles in cold) |
| Weather Occlusion Volume | Volume texture | Distance field |

## When to use this skill

These branches use Ultra Dynamic Weather assets and controls, not native Unreal weather systems.

- Making props or scenery materials respond to weather (wet, snowy, dusty).
- Adding footprints/tire tracks in snow or sand (landscape).
- Adding puddles to a landscape; a real water puddle in a recess.
- Rain drops dripping on glass windows.
- Foliage swaying in the wind.
- Rain ripples on water surfaces.
- Rainbow after a storm.
- Camera effects (droplets on the lens, frost, heat haze).
- Character breath visible in cold weather.
- Water dripping from a roof edge, or icicles hanging.

## Material Effects Overview

UDW exposes material functions that make your materials respond to weather's changing **material state**:

| Function | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| **Surface Weather Effects** | Solid surfaces (props, architecture) — not landscapes |
| **Dynamic Landscape Weather Effects V3** (DLWE) | Landscapes / ground meshes; supports interactive trails and ripples |
| **Glass Window Rain Drips** | Flat translucent glass |
| **Foliage Wind Movement** | Foliage models (WPO) |
| **Water Surface Rain Ripples** | Water surface normal |

### Simulate Changing Material State Over Time

In the **Material Effects** category on UDW.

| Setting | Behavior at runtime |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled *(default)* | Runtime material state changes gradually as weather changes (snow gradually accumulates while it snows) |
| Disabled | Runtime material state matches weather state directly. Changing Snow → Partly Cloudy makes Material Snow Coverage drop to 0 instantly. Required for Sequencer keyframes to play back identically. |

The time over which each transition happens (per weather type) is set in the same category.

## Surface Weather Effects

For solid scenery: props, architecture, decorations.

### Setup

```
1. Material palette → search "Weather" → Surface Weather Effects
2. Place at end of material graph, before material result
3. Uses Material Attributes pin (in + out)
   If your material doesn't use one, wrap with Make/Break Material Attributes
4. Static Bool nodes for "Apply Wetness" + "Apply Snow / Dust"
   Disabling unused effects reduces material complexity
5. Default UVs are world space (good for static scenery)
   For moving / skeletal: plug True into "Local Space" or "For Skeletal Mesh"
```

### Dripping and Droplets

Optional effects on wet surfaces, enabled via True into the `Dripping` and `Droplets` inputs.

| Effect | Look |
| --- | --- |
| Dripping | Rivulets of water moving down where wet |
| Droplets | Small water beads clinging to a smooth surface |

Both influenced by **Porosity** (0–1):

| Porosity | Surface example |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Car paint, plastic (smooth) |
| 1 | Concrete, sand (rough) |
| (unwired) | Derived from material roughness |

### Snow/Dust direction on rotating models

With Local Space or For Skeletal Mesh on, snow/dust uses the local normal — so it rotates with the model (snow on the side of a tipped-over object).

Fix: add the **Material Snow Dust Reorient** component as a child of the mesh. On begin play, add the dynamic material instance(s) using weather effects to the component's **Dynamic Material Instances** array. The component monitors rotation and slowly reorients snow/dust to face global up.

## Dynamic Landscape Weather Effects V3 (DLWE)

For landscapes and large ground meshes. More involved than Surface Weather Effects. Example in the UDS demo map.

### Setup

```
1. Material palette → search "Weather" → Dynamic Landscape Weather Effects V3
2. End of material graph, before material result
3. Uses material attributes pin (in + out) — same wrap pattern if needed
4. Static bools for "Apply Snow/Dust" + "Apply Wetness/Puddles"
```

### Interactions (Trails and Ripples)

Moving actors can leave trails in snow/dust and ripples in puddles via the **DLWE Interaction component**.

Add as a scene component, parented to any moving component on an actor, or to a bone. e.g. character footprints in snow → one DLWE Interaction component per foot, parented to each foot socket.

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Size` | How far interaction effects spread *and* how big the effects are. Match the diameter of the object it represents. |
| **DLWE Interaction Settings asset** | The full interaction configuration the component references. Use the default or create your own. |

### Render Target Area

Snow/dust trail interactions only happen within a render target area around the player. Scale: **Snow/Dust Interaction Render Target Area** on UDW.

The target dynamically recenters as the player pawn moves. To recenter from a different location, change **Control Point Location Source** in **Basic Controls** on UDW.

### Nanite Tessellation

DLWE supports nanite tessellation for snow/dust depth on nanite landscapes.

```
1. Project Settings: enable Nanite Tessellation
2. Material: check "Enable Tessellation"
3. Landscape actor: enable Nanite + build nanite mesh
4. DLWE node: plug True into "For Nanite Tessellation"
5. Set "Nanite Tessellation Magnitude" + "Nanite Tessellation Center"
   to match the material's tessellation settings.
   New landscape material with no existing displacement: Magnitude=1, Center=0
6. If you have existing displacement: plug False into
   "Displacement Input is World Scale" to keep DLWE from modifying it
```

### Blocking interaction effects with physical materials

Arrays on UDW, advanced dropdown of **DLWE** category:

| Array | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Physical Materials Which Disable Snow/Dust Sounds And Particles` | Phys mats in this array block snow/dust interaction effects |
| `Physical Materials Which Disable Puddle Sounds And Particles` | Same for puddles |

### Using DLWE on non-landscape meshes

To make Interaction components respond to surfaces other than landscape actors:

- Add physical materials for those surfaces to **Physical Materials which Enable DLWE Interactions on Non-Landscapes** in the DLWE Interaction Settings asset.
- Ensure static meshes use those phys mats.

### Virtual Shadow Maps

Set the landscape's **Shadow Cache Invalidation Behavior** to **Rigid** — keeps the WPO and Pixel Depth Offset used for snow depth from constantly invalidating shadows.

### Applying trail effect to underlying landscape layers

For other landscape layers (mud, sand) to also receive the snow/dust trail effect:

```
1. In material: give DLWE a "Custom Trail Surface Mask" input
   (0-1, typically from landscape layer samples)
2. In DLWE Interaction Settings asset:
   Add the relevant phys materials to
   "Custom Trail Surface Physical Materials"
   → component draws trails against those phys mats
     even with no snow/dust coverage present
```

Custom surface depth ranges from 0 to snow depth, scaled by the Custom Trail Surface Mask. Nanite tessellation gives the most convincing result.

### DLWE Interactions Not Happening

- Landscape needs World Static simple collision responding to queries and blocking Visibility. (Non-landscapes: see above.)
- DLWE Interaction component positioned and sized to trigger interactions.
- **Control Point Location Source** in advanced dropdown of Basic Controls — DLWE interactions happen around this point. Far camera = no visible effects.

## Glass Window Rain Drips

Refractive water droplets dripping down thin glass surfaces. Translucent materials only.

### Setup

```
1. Material palette → search "Weather" → Glass Window Rain Drips
2. Modifies Base Color + Opacity
   Outputs Base Color, Emissive Color, Opacity
   Use all three outputs for material result
3. UVs default to world space
   For moving surfaces, replace via the UVs input
```

## Foliage Wind Movement

Outputs world position offset for noise-based foliage movement based on UDW's wind. Foliage-focused.

If your foliage already has wind setup, it may be simpler to modify those effects to reference UDW's wind via the **Sample UDW Wind** node instead.

### Movement layers

| Layer | Frequency | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Small Movement** | High | Leaves, grass blades, branch tips |
| **Medium Movement** | Middle | Whole branches |
| **Large Movement** | Low | Entire mesh swaying with gusts |

All three on by default. Individually disable via `Apply` inputs.

### Masking

Each layer has a 0–1 mask input multiplied over its strength. Foliage models typically have vertex color channels for masking — inspect the model's vertex colors to know which channel does what.

**Small Movement** requires a mask input. Medium and Large auto-generate a simple mask if none is supplied (using position relative to the pivot); model-aware vertex masks are always better.

For foliage master materials, expose movement inputs as parameters for per-instance tuning.

## Water Surface Rain Ripples

Adds ripples to water surface normal based on rain amount.

### Setup

```
1. Material palette → search "Weather" → Water Surface Rain Ripples
2. End of material graph, before result
3. Only modifies normal —
   plug in your material's normal, plug output's normal into result
4. Two additional inputs: scale the ripple texture, adjust intensity on normal
```

## Controlling Your Own Material Effects with UDW

For custom material logic to react to UDW:

| Material node | Output |
| --- | --- |
| **Sample UDW Material State** | Material snow coverage, material dust coverage, material wetness. Also applies WOV + Weather Mask effects (like the weather effect functions do by default). |
| **Sample UDW Season** | 0–1 per season (total = 1) |
| **Sample UDW Wind** | Direction + intensity values/vectors |

Or reference the shared MPC `Ultra Dynamic Weather Parameters` at `Materials/Weather/` directly.

## Rainbow

Enable in **Rainbow** category on UDW.

| Condition for visibility | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Rain or fog contributing | Amount each contributes is set in Rainbow settings |
| Camera directly exposed to sunlight | Affected by cloud coverage; under overcast → no rainbow |
| Sun low enough for rainbow above horizon, OR camera high enough to see it from above | Geometric constraint |

Settings: rainbow visibility above cloud layer and below water level (if water level on).

## Screen Droplets

Water droplets on the screen when the camera is exposed to rain. Enable in **Screen Droplets** category.

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Droplet texture size | Visual scale |
| Effect strength | Intensity |
| Camera-facing dependency | How much the effect depends on facing the rain |
| **Underwater behavior** *(automatic with UDS Water Level)* | Turns off underwater; reapplies wet effect on resurface |

## Screen Frost

Frost/ice forming on the camera in snowy weather. Settings in **Screen Frost** category.

| Trigger | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Snow value | Weather state |
| Material snow | Material state |
| Manual contribution | Manually drive frost independent of weather |
| Form Duration / Clear Duration | Time to form/clear |
| **Interior masking** *(default)* | No frost when player is occluded (driven by Player Occlusion on UDS) |

## Heat Distortion

Post process effect distorting distant scenery with a shimmering/convection noise — heat haze. Category: **Heat Distortion**.

| Mode | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Calculated temperature value (see `udw-random-seasons-temperature`) |
| **Manual Heat Distortion** | Add distortion independent of temperature |

## Post Process Wind Fog

Extra fog noise in the local area around the camera, moving with wind and weather particles. Post process effect — much cheaper than the equivalent volumetric fog effects.

Intensity scales with fog / rain / snow / dust in current weather state.

Masking in interiors:

| Mask source | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Weather Occlusion Volume** *(default, best)* | Volume texture caching weather exposure around the camera via global distance field |
| Player Occlusion | Alternative |

## Placed, character, and water-linked effects

Read [references/placed-and-water-effects.md](references/placed-and-water-effects.md) only when
the task needs a Puddle Fluid Volume, dripping mesh particles, freezing breath, a Rain Drip
Spline or icicles, Weather Occlusion Volume, UDS water-level integration, or the current-weather
widget. The reference keeps each effect's placement, state source, masking, and cost constraints
co-located.

## Gotchas

- **Material doesn't respond to weather** — function isn't placed at the end of the material graph (before material result), or wrong Material Attributes wrap pattern.
- **Snow on a moving object goes the wrong direction** — Local Space / For Skeletal Mesh is on (correctly), but the **Material Snow Dust Reorient** component isn't added. Add it as a child of the mesh and register the dynamic material instance.
- **DLWE trails don't appear** — landscape needs World Static simple collision blocking Visibility (queries enabled). Or DLWE Interaction component is too small. Or `Control Point Location Source` is far from camera.
- **DLWE on a non-landscape mesh ignored** — phys material missing from the **Physical Materials which Enable DLWE Interactions on Non-Landscapes** array.
- **Snow depth invalidates virtual shadow maps every frame** — set landscape's **Shadow Cache Invalidation Behavior** to **Rigid**.
- **Glass Window Rain Drips wrong on a moving glass surface** — UVs default to world space. Replace via the `UVs` input.
- **Foliage Wind Movement: Small Movement does nothing** — Small Movement requires a mask input. Plug one in.
- **Rainbow never appears** — cloud coverage is too high (camera not exposed to sunlight); or sun too high; or neither rain nor fog is contributing.
- **Screen Frost appearing indoors** — Player Occlusion isn't detecting the interior. See `uds-modifiers-configs-state`.
- **Heat Distortion always at max** — calculated temperature is hot, OR Manual Heat Distortion is also driving it. Disable manual contribution.
- **Placed puddle, drip, or breath effect is wrong** — use the effect-specific troubleshooting in [references/placed-and-water-effects.md](references/placed-and-water-effects.md).
- **Custom material with Sample UDW Material State ignoring WOV / Weather Mask** — `Sample UDW Material State` already applies those by default. If you're not using it, you're not getting WOV/mask effects.
