# UDW spatial weather

The systems that make weather happen *somewhere specific* rather than globally. WOVs and Radial Storms drive state per location; the Weather Mask system excludes material effects from interiors and under-roof areas.

| System | Shape | Visible from outside? | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Weather Override Volume** | Arbitrary spline | No | Region-specific weather state, with arbitrary shape |
| **Radial Storm** | Circle | **Yes** (clouds, fog, obscured lightning) — requires Volumetric Clouds Sky Mode | A storm seen approaching from a distance; moving storms |
| **Weather Above Volumetric Clouds** | Above cloud layer | Implicit | Auto-adjusting weather state when the player flies above the cloud layer |
| **Weather Mask Brush** | Simple shape or painted texture, projected straight down | No | Mask material effects (snow/wetness) in interiors |
| **Weather Mask Projection Box** | Box-bounded capture of meshes inside, projected down | No | Mask material effects under structures (roofs) |

## When to use this skill

- Different weather in different parts of one level.
- A storm the player can see coming in from across the map.
- A storm that moves linearly across the level over time.
- Adjusting weather behavior when the camera goes above the cloud layer.
- Keeping snow accumulating inside a building, or wetness off the floor under a roof.

## Weather Override Volumes (WOV)

Actor for region-specific weather. Found at `Blueprints/Weather_Effects/`.

The region shape is defined by the actor's **spline component** — edit spline points for any shape. Right-click on the spline to add new points. You can scale the actor; avoid non-uniform scaling.

WOV weather configuration mirrors UDW's global controls:

- Select a preset for the WOV in its **Basic Controls** category.
- Enable Random Weather Variation on the WOV with its own probability maps. Timing/logic specifics come from UDW's Random Weather Variation category.

### Key WOV settings

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Transition Width` | How much space the volume devotes to blending outside → inside weather. The blend is purely spatial. **Default is small to keep the actor compact; a real-use WOV should be much larger with a wider transition width**, so players cross a smooth gradient. |
| `Priority` | How overlapping WOVs resolve |
| **Temperature** category | Local temperature range while the player is inside |
| Climate preset | Same effect as on UDS: sets probability maps + temperature ranges |
| `Apply Wind Direction` | If true, the volume's wind direction overrides as the player enters |

### Where the player is queried from

The location used to test against WOVs is set by **Control Point Location Source** in **Basic Controls** on UDW. Defaults to player pawn location.

| Control Point Location Source | Where weather/DLWE interactions sample from |
| --- | --- |
| Player Pawn *(default)* | Pawn location |
| Player Camera | Camera location |
| Manual | Vector variable you control |

### Material state across the WOV boundary

By default, WOVs draw their material state into a render target sampled by the weather material functions, so:

- A snowy region appears snowy from outside.
- From inside, you see the lack of snow coverage outside.

Disable or adjust on UDW from the **Weather Override Volumes** category.

### Runtime WOV functions

| Function | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ChangeWeather(preset, duration)` (on WOV) | Transitions the WOV to a specific static preset |
| `ChangeToRandomWeatherVariation()` (on WOV) | Transitions the WOV to its random variation |

### Custom Volume Behavior

To use a WOV for something other than weather (e.g. fire custom events when the player crosses into the region):

```
1. Create a child of the Weather Override Volume class
2. Override Custom Volume Behavior on the child

The function runs from UDW when the WOV affects local weather.
Input: Alpha (0-1) — how much the player is inside the volume.
```

## Radial Storms

Circular weather region actor. **Unique vs WOVs**: can render its own *local effects* and *local cloud coverage* — players see the storm in the distance as a cloud formation with fog and obscured lightning beneath. Built to be dynamic — spawn at runtime, fade in/out, move linearly.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Distant-storm visuals only work with Sky Mode = Volumetric Clouds | With other Sky Modes, a Radial Storm still works to affect weather state by player position (like a WOV), just without visible distant storm |
| Despite the name, can apply *any* weather inside (incl. calm/clear) | Named for the typical use case |

### Periodic spawning

UDW's **Radial Storm Spawning** category enables periodic randomized spawning during play. UDW spawns radial storms one at a time, placing/moving them so they pass over the player. The weather preset can be season-determined (similar to Random Weather Variation in `udw-random-seasons-temperature`).

### Manual spawning and control

You can spawn at runtime or place one in the editor — UDW's spawning system isn't required.

| Function on the Radial Storm actor | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Fade In Storm(duration)` | Start storm fading from 0 → 1 alpha. Use after spawning. |
| `Fade Out Storm(duration)` | Fade out over time, then destroy the actor |
| `Move Storm Over Time(targetPosition, duration, fadeOutAtEnd)` | Move linearly to target over duration. Optional final-fade-and-destroy. |

Example flow:

```
storm = SpawnActor(RadialStorm_BP, location)
storm.FadeInStorm(30)                              // 30s fade in
storm.MoveStormOverTime(targetPos, 200, true)      // 200s movement
// fade-out auto starts in last 30s of the movement
```

## Weather Above Volumetric Clouds

When UDS's Sky Mode is **Volumetric Clouds**, UDW by default adjusts weather state when the player goes above the cloud layer.

Configurable in the **Weather Above Volumetric Clouds** category on UDW. Enable/disable the adjustments entirely, or change the multipliers per weather value used when above clouds.

## Weather Mask System

Masks the material weather effects (snow, dust, wetness) in specific spaces — by default they affect everywhere globally.

Two component classes at `Blueprints/Weather_Effects/Components/` draw into a weather mask render target sampled by the weather material functions. Use the components directly in your actors, or use wrapper actor classes in `Blueprints/Weather_Effects/`.

### Weather Mask Brush

Draws a simple shape or a painted texture. The actor's `Brush` variable selects between them. Can be scaled non-uniformly and rotated on Z axis.

Because the system works by drawing into a render target, shapes are **always projected straight down on Z axis**.

| Per-brush setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Mask Wetness` | How much this brush masks wetness |
| `Mask Snow/Dust` | How much this brush masks snow/dust |
| `Cancel Masks Above` | Disables any brush masking above the actor's height within the brush's rectangle |

#### Painted brush textures

For more control than simple shapes, paint a texture using the **Weather Mask Brush Painter**:

- **Ultra Dynamic Sky** dropdown on the level editor toolbar, *or*
- `Blueprints/Tools/`

With the painter open, select a weather mask brush actor and click the button to start painting. Controls:

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Right-click | Pan |
| Drag middle mouse | Zoom |
| Left mouse | Paint |
| Top bar | Adjust brush and value being painted |

When finished, click **Save** — painted mask saves to a texture in `UDS_LevelData/` next to the level.

### Weather Mask Projection Box

Captures meshes within the box and uses their shapes to mask weather effects straight down. Place around a complex structure (e.g. a building) and the mesh shapes occlude directly beneath them.

Placement tips:

- Place the box so it encompasses **only** the relevant mesh geometry. e.g. enclose just the roof of a house.
- Width/length as small as possible to fit the occluding geometry — eliminates wasted render-target resolution.

| Per-box exposed setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Amount snow/dust and wetness masked | Per-component mask strength |
| Blur of the mask beneath the box when drawn into the target | Softness |

### Material-level opt-out

Static switch parameters on individual materials/instances:

| Parameter | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Apply Weather Mask Brushes to Wetness` | Disable mask effects on wetness in this material |
| `Apply Weather Mask Brushes to Snow` | Same for snow |

### Mask distance and update

Mask effects stop at a certain distance from the camera, set by the render target width. Adjust in **Weather Mask Target** category on UDW.

### Fading a mask component

```
WeatherMaskBrush.FadeMaskOverTime(duration)
// or
WeatherMaskProjectionBox.FadeMaskOverTime(duration)
// Default fade rate: 20 updates/sec.
// Adjust via Weather Mask Update Period on UDW.
```

## Gotchas

- **WOV transition looks abrupt** — `Transition Width` is too small (default is). Make it much larger so the player crosses a smooth gradient.
- **Radial Storm not visible from outside** — Sky Mode isn't Volumetric Clouds. Distant-storm visuals require Volumetric Clouds; with other modes the storm still affects state but renders no visible distant storm.
- **WOV not affecting weather** — `Control Point Location Source` is set to a custom vector that isn't where the player is. Default to Player Pawn.
- **Weather Mask not stopping snow inside a building** — Weather Mask Brush or Projection Box not placed; or `Mask Snow/Dust` value too low; or render target distance exceeded.
- **Mask Projection Box has artifacts** — box is too large, wasting render-target resolution. Shrink to just enclose the occluding geometry.
- **Material ignoring Weather Mask** — `Apply Weather Mask Brushes to Wetness/Snow` static switches on the material are off.
- **Snow visible outside the WOV from inside** — `Weather Override Volumes` category on UDW has the material-state-rendering option turned off. Enable it for "snowy outside / not snowy inside" reads.
- **Per-storm logic from a child class not running** — for a WOV, override `Custom Volume Behavior` (not the parent's behavior). For a Radial Storm, similar pattern via child class.
- **Wind direction not changing inside a WOV** — `Apply Wind Direction` on the WOV is off. Enable for region-specific wind.
